# The Scrum@Scale Guide
This is the repository for the Official Scrum@Scale&reg; Guide.

We believe that, as with any project, the best way to get the strongest guide possible is through a sequence of "inspect and adapt" cycles based on feedback from S@S Trainers, S@S Practitioners, and the Scrum community at large.    Scrum@Scale as a framework is being used in companies of different sizes, in different industries, and on different continents; it is truly global.  Our goal is to capture insights and best practices from the global community and consolidate them into a continuously improving guide.

All contributors to the guide, including the primary author, Dr. Jeff Sutherland, will use the same process outlined below to submit additions and improvements to the guide for community discussion and eventual incorporation into the official guide.

## How to Suggest an Improvement

If you have an idea for how to make the Scrum@Scale Guide better please either open an "Issue" or create a "Pull Request".

### When to open an issue
Opening an issue is appropriate when you feel that you have identified an area where the guide needs to be changed, but you do not have a specific suggestion for what the new version text should be.  Opening an Issue will create a discussion thread where the community can discuss your issue.  We will turn issues into user stories for improvements to the guide and will prioritize and address them over time.

You can also open an issue if you have a question about that guide that you would like someone from the community to answer.

### When to submit a pull request
If you have a concrete change or addition to the guide that you would like to suggest, you can edit the guide itself and submit your changes as a pull request.  We will allow a brief period for community discussion on the pull request and then evaluate it before merging part or all of it into the official guide as appropriate.

## Cadence
In the short term, we will be evaluating and pulling in changes on a monthly cycle.  While the guide is new, our goal is to release an update at least once a month.

## Guide Format
The Scrum@Scale guide is in Latex format, which is a standard for academic papers and journals world-wide.  There are a wide range of free and open Latex editors, for a complete list see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors.

## Guide translations
If you would like to translate the guide into another language please do so and submit a pull request with your translated version using a file name like guide-language.tex.  If you are not comformtable working in Latex, feel free to submit a translation in HTML, Word or .txt format and the community can coordinate with you to port that translation into Latex.
